# TCSS445GroupProject
A group project for TCSS445:

Brief description of goals:

Our objective is to develop a user-friendly platform that allows both patients and medical professionals to communicate remotely about patient health issues, as well as track and monitor these concerns in a centralized location. It is important for patients with severe health concerns, to be able to easily and safely monitor their health, and if their symptoms over time. This will be achieved by utilizing Node.js to build a modern website to take input regarding symptoms and concerns; then utilizing SQL to store patient information along with their medical history and symptoms.
